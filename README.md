## About The Project

[FantasyLab](https://devpost.com/software/fantasylab) is a project developed during the [Treasure Hacks 3.5](https://treasurehacks-3-5.devpost.com/) hackathon. Our goal was to create a tool that could help RPG game masters to create characters, stories, and ambiance for their games. Our web application uses OpenAI's DALL-E and GPT 3.5 Turbo models to generate images and texts based on the user's input.

### Built With

* [ ReactJS ]( https://legacy.reactjs.org/ )
* [ GPT 3.5 Model ]( https://platform.openai.com/docs/models )
* [ DALL-E Model ]( https://openai.com/research/dall-e )

| Judge | Score | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Judge 1 | 42 | 13<br>11<br>6<br>7<br>5 |
| Judge 2 | 65 | 20 - The idea is rather new.<br>5 - In real life the game developers would realistically use their own implementation to generate character images.<br>15 - It would be great to hear some explanations on the technical part of the solution, the decision process, etc.<br>10 - It would be great to hear some explanations on the technical part of the solution, the decision process, etc.<br>15 - The solution fully utilises 2 OpenAI APIs. |
| Judge 3 | 90 | 25 - Project is generating new images in a creative way.<br>25 - This could be used by game devs.<br>15 - Idea was mostly presented clearly.<br>10 - UI to take inputs from the user was very rudimentary.<br>15 - Uses Gen AI. |
| Judge 4 | 50 | 10 - Not new idea.<br>10 - I think there is no need to create such separate app.<br>10 - It's ok.<br>5 - There is no demonstration of app.<br>15 - Use GPT-3.5 and Dall-e APIs. |
